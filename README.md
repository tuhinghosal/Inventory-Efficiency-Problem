# Inventory-Efficiency-Problem
The topic of this post is inventory management using Power bi.
A data set was obtained from Kaggle, and the re-order point, XYZ analysis and ABC classification were calculated.

After calculating, these are my inferences:
1.Inventory distribution is done efficiently on an annual basis.
2.Despite the fact that current stock distribution is inefficient. The cause for this is SKUs with fluctuating demand. It is kept in huge amounts by this organization.
4. 11.33 percent of SKUs generate 70 percent of revenue.
5.In
 June and Julyâ€”demand is quite low during these two months.
6.Inventory turnover ratio (a measure of how many times inventory is sold or utilized in a given time period, such as a year) for "A" category items with uniform demand is higher than for others, indicating how efficiently firms manage inventory.
